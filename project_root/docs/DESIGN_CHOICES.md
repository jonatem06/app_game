# Design Choices

## Game Engine/Framework

For this project, we will proceed with the **Godot Engine** due to the following reasons:

*   **Open Source and Free:** Godot is released under the MIT license, making it completely free to use without royalties or hidden fees.
*   **Multi-platform Export:** Godot provides robust support for exporting games to major platforms including Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux with relative ease.
*   **Dedicated 2D Engine:** While Godot is also capable in 3D, its 2D engine is mature, feature-rich, and optimized, which is ideal for a tower defense game.
*   **Node-based System:** Godot's scene system, based on nodes, is intuitive for structuring game elements and behaviors.
*   **GDScript:** Godot's native scripting language, GDScript, is Python-like, making it easy to learn and use, especially for rapid prototyping and development.
*   **Community Support:** Godot has a large and active community, providing ample tutorials, documentation, and third-party tools.

Alternatively, other engines like Unity (more industry-standard but with different licensing) or frameworks like Phaser (for web-focused games using JavaScript/TypeScript) could be considered, but Godot offers a strong balance of features, ease of use, and flexibility for this specific project requirements.
